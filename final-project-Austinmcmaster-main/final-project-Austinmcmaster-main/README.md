# Final Project Repository 

#### Express serves an API Project
This project we will use mongoDB, JSON and implement a RESTful API,
and I want to implement this for the calander portion of my project. To test we will use postman to test the basic commands.

### Time taken
Approximatly 4-5 hours. I watch a tutorial which was about an 1 hour long
which walked me through how to create a project like this so I just modified it as I went.


#### Project Dockerize your Servers
We changed from using Mongo DB which was a local server to Docker based server.


#### Secure API Project
This project was a lot of work and now looking back on it there are many things I would like to improve. This has given me
great desire to continue improving my vision for this project. We added User entity which is super cool and now we have ways to combine events and users together.
Though there is furthur work to do there. We also added authorization which only allows for certain people to access the site if they have logged in or signed up.
Overall a super cool project.

Took 6-7 hours of coding. I took my time. Please forgive me for turning it in an hour late. Debugging some things.
